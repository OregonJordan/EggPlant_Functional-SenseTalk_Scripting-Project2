# EggPlant_Functional-SenseTalk_Scripting-Project2

EggPlant Function is a black-box GUI test automation tool, developed by TestPlant. Its approach uses image matching technology as opposed to looking to the object-level of the application being tested. This allows for system-wide automation of a system-under-test as opposed to an application-specific solution. It also means that the technology used to build the application to be tested does not matter, nor does the system that the application runs on. EggPlant utilizes a high level, object oriented scripting language called SenseTalk.
